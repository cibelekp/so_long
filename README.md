# so_long

This project is a 2D video game developed as part of my coursework at 42 coding school. It's designed to showcase proficiency in C programming and the use of MiniLibX, a graphics library.

MiniLibX is a lightweight graphics library used for creating simple graphical applications, particularly in the context of educational and small-scale projects like those at 42 school. More on MiniLibX at https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx
